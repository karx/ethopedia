<!-- ## The Results


## As said by them
```
Working with Akriya Technologies was an enriching experience which too in collaboration with Dlf mall of india, a place where every Marketing student aspire to work.
My learning from this live project  was super cool from asking the customer to upload pics of any of those Mannequin to their instagram handle and to convice them to play the game of fortune was totally a different experience from what i have learnt till now in my PGDM programme.

It was really a great experience where i get to know more about the customer insights, How much it is difficult of convincing an unknown people  and try to make them your potential customer.

How can i forgot those super cool outfits from different brands which too was in collaboration with ELLE Fashion magazine,a magazine with a good brand image.
The best thing what i learned from this live project was how to do a one to one contact with your potential customer,How to convince them and makes them feel that this place is for you only.

I still remember those pretty smiles on my customers faces when they get goodies form Akriya Technologies super cool vending machine.
What i learned was totally different from what i have studied till now, both of them are totally different its really hard to convince customer and to make them your potential customer. But with the help of kartik sir i was able to do so for which i am thankful to him.
Working with Akriya Technologies was totally a different experience.


I would love to be a part of Akriya Technologies in future also.
Thank you so much for this live project.

# Event Proposal - `Kreeda Kendra`

## About Us
`Kreeda Kendra` is a small experience meetup set up for a group of like-minded individuals-associates-partners. We have discussed, debated, felt, and contributed towards this new age of connected devices in the last few years. 

This year, to enforce more information sharing, experience sharing and also maintain a healthy feedback loop, I present
`Kreeda Kendra` - a makeshift gaming-themed experience centre.

We aim to showcase and present new and interesting use-cases of tools and products created for technologies of IoT Networks, Computing and Data Science.


## On 29th Febuary
 - 1 x CS:GO Finals 5v5
 - 2 x 1v1 Booths for (CS:GO/FIFA/Rocket League) 
 - 1 x Retro Game A 
 - 1 x Retro Game B

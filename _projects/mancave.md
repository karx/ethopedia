## The Man Cave
Etho's primary base where he resides in his LP world. The Man cave is being built trying to maintain the natural generation of the cave, keeping it as natural as possible. Mostly lit by hidden lighting (even lava!). 

The mancave is filled with arche, bridges, rivers and waterfalls. There are even hidden indicators that tell us if its day, night. There is a day/night time lullaby.

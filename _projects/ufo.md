One of the most unique builds of the Etho.

You could fish cows from the UFO.

## How did it work
From the fishing spot, you could, using a fishing rod, pull up a cow to the water streams above, and the cows would then get pushed towards a holding area.

Now Cows don't get pulled enough to reach the water streams.

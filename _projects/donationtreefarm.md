## What is the Tree Farm?
The tree farm is one of the earliest builds in Etho's current LP world.

* Donation Signage
The tree farm also houses signs commemorating the donations recieved to kickstart the series. There are more donation signages in the [Mineshaft](./mineshaft)

* Mural
We have mural artwork by Etho on the walls, showcasing the various biomes in Minecraft.

* The Floaty Slime
We have a big slime that you can find circling the farm every so often, fed from the [Slime Farm](./slimefarm)
